# Openhouse
An android application that provides an open door for the people of an organisation to put up their issues.

# Problem
As a student/employee we face many problems in our daily lives and to get them solved from the management/organisation we have to follow a hierarchy in the authority which is very time consuming. Even after the whole process many of the issues remain unsolved or not taken into consideration.
This process not only waste the time of the student but also the management and the faculty members, as different students come up with the same problem again and again. The management is piled up with a lot of complaints due to which the genuine ones are also ignored.
This effects the management economically too, as they have to do the same job again and again.
 This method of handling the complaints manually is problematic both for students as well as the management.


# Solution
 “OPEN HOUSE “is an application that provides an open door for all the students to put their issues in front of the concerned authority i.e Admin. The admin approves the complaint only if it is genuine.
Once he approves the complaint , it is visible to all the other people.
The people facing the same problems can respond so that the common issue is taken into consideration first.
This application helps to put forward all the problems in front of the management so that the management takes immediate actions to resolve them and also solves our problem by saving the time of the student as well as the management.
